# Final Interview

## Approach to Vague Problem

### Description
This problem was built to evaluate problem solving skills. In Twitter, @budescode said in July 20, 2020: "To replace programmers with Robots, clients will have to accurately describe what they want. We're safe." This problem does not intend to evaluate your programming skills on what ChatGPT can do, but it will evaluate your programming skills on what ChatGPT cannot do. In the rare occasion you might have some technical debt, you would find it easy to overpass it with little Googleing. However, you must first have a nice understanding of what you should do. 

**The problem**: Return True or False for wether a turtle can or cannot outrun a cheetah in a race.

### Constraints
* You must implement a Python function which returns True or False.
* Your function must have at least 3 inputs and at most 5 inputs.
* Your function must return different results depending on the inputs given.
* You choose what the inputs are and what the criteria are to determine the output.
* Python coding counts, but how you structure your solution counts even more.

### Hints
* There is no correct answer.
* Say out loud what you are thinking.
* You are being evaluated by your thinking process, not your answer output.

### Solution (without code)
There are various possible solutions to this. The problem describes there must be different outputs depending on inputs, so a first step would be thinking of inputs that may make it possible for a turtle to outrun a cheetah in a race. The easiest approach is to determine binary inputs. 

However, quantitative approaches using int or float inputs are largely appreciated as ways to solve this problem. This demo solution will go the simple way to showcase the problem can be resolved in the simplest way possible, as candidates would feel pressured to make the most complew way. 

Consider the following inputs:
* vegetarian_food_in_finish_line (binary) 
* zebra_is_alive (binary)
* race_track_lenght_meters (int)
* zebra_start_position_racetrack (int)

Any logic with the inputs given can lead to an answer considered correct, as long as the constraints are respected. With this framing, a solution is easy to be found.

### Time and space complexity
Both time and space complexities would normally be O(1) for most solutions.
